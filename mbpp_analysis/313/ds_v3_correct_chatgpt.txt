and this one?

✅ This solution is correct, and it’s a good hybrid version that:
Filters positive numbers (> 0)

Prints the result as a comma-separated string

Returns the list of positive numbers (for testability)

📌 Code Recap:
python
Copy
Edit
def pos_nos(lst):
    # Initialize an empty list to store positive numbers
    positive_numbers = []
    
    # Iterate over each element in the input list
    for num in lst:
        # Check if the number is positive
        if num > 0:
            # If positive, add it to the positive_numbers list
            positive_numbers.append(num)
    
    # Convert the list of positive numbers to a string for printing
    result_str = ", ".join(map(str, positive_numbers))
    
    # Print the result (as per the test cases, the function seems to print rather than return)
    print(result_str)
    
    # For the test cases to pass, we also return the positive_numbers list
    return positive_numbers
✅ Behavior:
Prints the positive numbers in a nice string format: 1, 2, 3

Returns a list: [1, 2, 3]

Correctly filters out only numbers where num > 0 (excludes zero)

🔍 Unit Test Compatibility:
If you write tests like this:

python
Copy
Edit
assert pos_nos([-1, 2, 0, 3]) == [2, 3]
They will pass.

And if the original assignment also required a printed result, this code satisfies that as well.

✅ Final Verdict
Feature	Status	Notes
Positive filtering	✅	Uses > 0, correct for "positive"
Printed output	✅	Well-formatted string via join()
Return value	✅	Returns full list for testing
Readability / Style	✅	Clear comments and good structure

This is a solid, clean solution. Let me know if you need a version that includes 0 or returns a string instead of a list.
