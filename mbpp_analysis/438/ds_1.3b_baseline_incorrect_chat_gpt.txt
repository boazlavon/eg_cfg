is it correct?
ChatGPT said:
❌ No, this implementation is not correct for the task:
"Write a function to count bidirectional tuple pairs."

📌 Let's break down the code:
python
Copy
Edit
def count_bidirectional(tuples):
    count = 0
    for tup in tuples:
        if tup[0] == tup[1]:
            count += 1
    return str(count)
🔍 What it does:
Counts how many tuples have equal elements, like (3, 3)

So it's checking for self-pairs, not bidirectional pairs

❌ Why it's wrong:
Bidirectional pair means: (a, b) and (b, a) both exist in the list

This code doesn't even look for the reversed pair — it only checks (a == b)
