what about this solution?
  "code": "import math\n\ndef distance_lat_long(lat1, long1, lat2, long2):\n    # Convert degrees to radians\n    lat1, long1, lat2, long2 = map(math.radians, [lat1, long1, lat2, long2])\n\n    # Haversine formula\n    dlat = lat2 - lat1\n    dlong = long2 - long1\n    a = math.sin(dlat/2)**2 + math.cos(lat1) * math.cos(lat2) * math.sin(dlong/2)**2\n    c = 2 * math.atan2(math.sqrt(a), math.sqrt(1-a))\n\n    # Distance in km\n    distance = 6371 * c\n\n    return distance",


ChatGPT said:
✅ Yes, this solution is correct. It’s a clean implementation of the Haversine formula using proper conversions and math.

✔️ What it does well:
Converts all coordinates to radians using:

python
Copy
Edit
lat1, long1, lat2, long2 = map(math.radians, [...])
Applies the Haversine formula correctly:

python
Copy
Edit
a = sin²(Δlat/2) + cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * sin²(Δlong/2)
c = 2 * atan2(√a, √(1 - a))
distance = R * c
Uses the correct Earth radius in kilometers (6371 km).

🔁 Optional Suggestions (style only):
To improve clarity slightly, you might rename long1 and long2 to lon1 and lon2, since long is a reserved keyword in some Python 2 contexts.

✅ Verdict:
This solution is mathematically correct, concise, and well-structured.
It will return accurate results for global latitude/longitude distance queries.
