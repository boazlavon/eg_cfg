what about this solution?


ChatGPT said:
✅ This solution is correct and well-implemented.

It uses the Haversine formula, which is the standard and accurate method to compute great-circle distances between two points on the Earth’s surface.

🔍 Why it’s correct:
Coordinates converted to radians — ✅ necessary and done correctly.

Earth radius is in kilometers — ✅ 6371.0 is the standard average.

Haversine formula is used — ✅ more accurate than the spherical law of cosines, especially for small distances.

Clean, readable code.

🔢 Example:

Edit
distance_lat_long(36.12, -86.67, 33.94, -118.40)
# Output ≈ 2887.26 km (correct)
✅ Final Verdict:
This is the best of the three solutions you shared.
It’s accurate, readable, and handles inputs in degrees as expected.
