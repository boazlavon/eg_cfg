wrong float comparison.
it make 
"import math\n\ndef volume_cone(radius, height):\n    volume = (1/3) * math.pi * radius**2 * height\n    return volume"
wrong since it yields 6426.65137169352 instead of 6426.651371693521
which is due to multiplication by 1/3 and not 1.0/3
but of course it's correct...
