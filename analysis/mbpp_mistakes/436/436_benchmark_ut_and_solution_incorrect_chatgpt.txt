ChatGPT said:
Let’s evaluate the function and the unit tests.

🔍 Prompt:
"Write a Python function to print negative numbers in a list."

❌ Function Review
Code:
python
Copy
Edit
def neg_nos(list1):
  for num in list1: 
    if num < 0: 
       return num 
❌ Problems:
The function returns only the first negative number — due to the immediate return inside the loop.

It does not print anything, although the prompt asks for printing.

If the goal is to return all negative numbers, this is incorrect.

If the goal is to print them, this is also not doing that.

❌ Unit Test Review
Test cases:
python
Copy
Edit
assert neg_nos([-1,4,5,-6]) == -1,-6
assert neg_nos([-1,-2,3,4]) == -1,-2
assert neg_nos([-7,-6,8,9]) == -7,-6
❌ Problems:
Syntax like == -1,-6 is incorrect — Python reads this as:

python
Copy
Edit
(assert neg_nos(...) == -1), -6
Which is not what you want.

Even if the function returned a list, the test would still be incorrect in format.

✅ Correct Implementation (return list)
If we want to return all negative numbers (best for testing):

python
Copy
Edit
def neg_nos(lst):
    return [num for num in lst if num < 0]
Correct tests:
python
Copy
Edit
assert neg_nos([-1, 4, 5, -6]) == [-1, -6]
assert neg_nos([-1, -2, 3, 4]) == [-1, -2]
assert neg_nos([-7, -6, 8, 9]) == [-7, -6]
✅ If you want to print instead:
python
Copy
Edit
def neg_nos(lst):
    for num in lst:
        if num < 0:
            print(num)
But then unit testing becomes hard unless you capture stdout.

✅ Final Verdict
Item	Verdict	Fix Needed?
Function	❌ Wrong — returns only first neg	✅ Needs rewrite
Unit tests	❌ Invalid syntax and logic	✅ Needs list-based asserts
Corrected version	✅ [num for num in lst if num < 0]	—

Let me know if you'd like the function to print or return, or both.
