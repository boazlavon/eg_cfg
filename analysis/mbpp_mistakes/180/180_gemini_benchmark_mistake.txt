is it correct?



It's almost correct, but there's a crucial detail missing that will lead to incorrect results.

Here's the corrected version and the explanation:

Python

from math import radians, sin, cos, acos

def distance_lat_long(slat, slon, elat, elon):
    # Convert all latitudes and longitudes from degrees to radians
    slat_rad = radians(slat)
    slon_rad = radians(slon)
    elat_rad = radians(elat)
    elon_rad = radians(elon)

    dist = 6371.01 * acos(sin(slat_rad) * sin(elat_rad) + cos(slat_rad) * cos(elat_rad) * cos(slon_rad - elon_rad))
    return dist
The crucial correction and why it's necessary:

The sin(), cos(), and acos() functions in Python's math module (and most other programming languages) expect their arguments to be in radians, not degrees. Latitude and longitude are typically expressed in degrees.

Your original code was passing degree values directly to sin(), cos(), and acos(), which would lead to incorrect calculations. The radians() function from the math module is used to convert the degree values to radians before they are used in the Haversine formula (which is what this formula is a simplified version of).

Explanation of the formula (Haversine-like):

This formula is a variation of the Haversine formula, which is commonly used to calculate the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere given their longitudes and latitudes.

6371.01: This is the average radius of the Earth in kilometers. If you need the distance in miles, you would use approximately 3958.76 miles.
slat, slon: Starting latitude and longitude (in degrees, but converted to radians in the corrected code).
elat, elon: Ending latitude and longitude (in degrees, but converted to radians in the corrected code).
sin() and cos(): Trigonometric functions.
acos(): Inverse cosine function (returns the angle in radians).
The core of the formula calculates the angular distance between the two points on the sphere, and then multiplies it by the Earth's radius to get the linear distance.
With the radians() conversions, your function will correctly calculate the distance between two points using latitude and longitude.
