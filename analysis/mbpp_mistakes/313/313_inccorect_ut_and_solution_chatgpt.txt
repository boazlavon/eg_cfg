is the solution correct? is the ut correct?

Let’s evaluate both the function and the unit tests.

🔍 Prompt:
"Write a Python function to print positive numbers in a list."

❌ Function Review
Code:
python
Copy
Edit
def pos_nos(list1):
    for num in list1: 
        if num >= 0: 
           return num
❌ Problems:
It returns only the first positive number due to the return inside the loop.

It does not print anything despite the prompt asking to “print.”

It returns a single number, not multiple.

✅ A correct version (to return them as a list):
python
Copy
Edit
def pos_nos(lst):
    return [num for num in lst if num >= 0]
If the goal is to print instead:

python
Copy
Edit
def pos_nos(lst):
    for num in lst:
        if num >= 0:
            print(num)
❌ Unit Test Review
Test list:
python
Copy
Edit
"assert pos_nos([-1,-2,1,2]) == 1,2"
"assert pos_nos([3,4,-5]) == 3,4"
"assert pos_nos([-2,-3,1]) == 1"
❌ Problems:
These use syntax like == 1,2, which is invalid — 1,2 is interpreted as a tuple, and assert compares against it.

They expect multiple values to be returned directly, which is not how Python works.

✅ Correct version (assuming return list):
python
Copy
Edit
assert pos_nos([-1, -2, 1, 2]) == [1, 2]
assert pos_nos([3, 4, -5]) == [3, 4]
assert pos_nos([-2, -3, 1]) == [1]
✅ Final Verdict
Item	Status	Fix
Function	❌ Incorrect	Only returns first positive, does not print all
Unit tests	❌ Invalid syntax & logic	Use list comparisons
Recommended fix	✅ Use list comprehension or loop + print	depends on goal

Would you like both a print version and a return version of the function with matching tests?
